## Introduction

Hey! Welcome to Neotutor, a website that will teach you the basics on how to make your very own personal website! This guide will have everything you will need, from nothing to a beautiful creation of your own. As social media continues to get worse and worse, I felt like this would be a good thing to write up.

## Why should I have a website?

Here are some reasons on why you might want to have your own webpage:

* Put it in your social media profile so people can get to know you better
* Write about your life
* Show off photos you've taken
* Show off art you've made
* Sell commissions
* Show off music you've made

If any of these apply to you, then consider reading more of this.

## But isn't making a website so hard hacker coding?

Not really, as long as you can understand the basics of logic and design, you should be fine. Anyone can make a website with a bit of effort and help from a guide or the broader internet!

## Guide

Now that you've determined you have reasoning and the time to make a website, let's get started!

1. [How do Websites work?](#how-do-websites-work)

# How do websites work?

I'm not going to get too specific, but basically there is a server with all the information to your website somewhere in the world. This could be your home computer, a datacenter in Silicon Valley, or even a [Raspberry Pi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi)! When the server gets a request to send you a website, it will determine all the info it needs to send to you and then give your computer all the needed files to show a website. This all works over a protocol called **H**yper**t**ext **T**ransfer **P**rotocol (HTTP) which you can find the technical details about [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP)

1. Client (You) asking for the website files
2. The server gives you the website file(s) if it can find them

### What files are used for programming websites?

The main files you'll find for the structure of a website are:

1. Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) (.html, .htm)
2. Cascasding Style Sheet (CSS) (.css)
3. JavaScript (JS) (.js)

HTML is like the foundation of your website, it determines where things on your website will be placed, such as text, images, and tables.

CSS is like the paint job it's used to style all the different parts of your website that were made with HTML. You can use CSS to make your website look like almost anything you want.

JavaScript is used to make your website more interactive by adding code. Some examples would be making a sound play when you click a button or making a simple game on your website.

# Setup

Let's setup our workspace for making a website. In this guide we will be using a free website hosting service called [Neocities](https://neocities.org). They make setting up a website a lot easier while still allowing you to program in regular web development languages (HTML, CSS, and JS)

First, you will need to sign up for a Neocities account, which you can do on their [homepage](https://neocities.org).

Once you have signed up for Neocities, you can navegate to the [dashboard](https://neocities.org/dashboard) by clicking on your name in the topbar and then clicking edit. You should now be in your dashboard, it should look something like this:

![Signup Page](assets/images/dashboard.png)

Your website will have different files because by default it will only have a HTML and CSS file. From there, you can upload files or click on files to edit them, which will be needed for the next section on HTML.
